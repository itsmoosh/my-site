			<h2 id="qual">Professional Qualifications</h2>			
			<p>			
				Marshall is proud to host a strong set of technical, communicative, and analytic skills. He has developed these skills through 
				 extensive classroom teaching and tutoring experience, personal projects, undergraduate and graduate research, employment,
				 and coursework. Details of Marshall's experience <a href="pages/experience.shtml#exp">may be found below</a>.
			</p>
			<h3 id="tech">Technical Skills</h3>
			<p>
				With a large body of experience using graphic design, data processing, document preparation software, and many programming languages,
				 Marshall has a well-rounded technical r&eacute;sum&egrave;. His always-growing expertise with the software and languages he uses 
				 supports <a href="pages/research.shtml">his research</a> and personal projects, including this website. He also has extensive experience
				 with all major operating systems, including command-line interfaces in Windows, Mac OSX, Ubuntu, and Scientific Linux.
			</p>
			<p>
				Adobe Illustrator is the primary graphic design program used by <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwpeg/">the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington (UWPEG)</a>
				 to create figures for printed and online curricular materials. In the course of his research with UWPEG, Marshall has created and manipulated
				 thousands of carefully-crafted figures for educational works, occasionally involving GIMP for advanced image processing as needed.
				 FileMaker, Origin, and MS Excel have each seen extended use for data processing in Marshall's varied research projects. With MS Word, Vi, 
				 and LaTeX, Marshall has constructed hundreds of documents--curricular materials, written coursework, research papers, memoranda for 
				 collaborators, personal documents, and more. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marshall's programming expertise is both broad and deep. He has worked extensively with C++, JavaScript, Python, LabVIEW, and HTML.
				 He has also involved smaller projects utilizing ROOT, C, BASH, Mathematica, jQuery, Assembly, GlowScript, and XML in his coursework,
				 research, employment, and personal time. The wide variety of programming experience Marshall has developed enables him to learn new
				 languages quickly and with ease.
			</p> 
			<p>
				To track changes to curricular materials, UWPEG uses Apache Subversion and Trac issue ticketing; Marshall is now well-versed with both. 
				 Recreationally, he has also used Redmine bug tracking software as a volunteer tester for the video games
				 <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/">Kerbal Space Program</a> and <a href="https://openmw.org/">the OpenMW project</a>. The linux
				 computer Marshall uses to play-test these programs he personally built from component parts. 
				 
			</p>
			<p>				 
				Marshall has also engaged in several hardware projects in a laboratory setting. His background and training includes cryogens;
				 radioactive materials and environments; high- and ultra-high-vacuum systems; oxygen-free environments; experiment design,
				 fabrication, software development, and documentation; and of course, operation, data collection, and analysis. Each experiment
				 has intersected multiple categories.
				 For more information about Marshall's lab experience, see <a href="pages/experience.shtml#exp">the experience section below</a>.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Personal Skills</h2>
			<p>			
				Being an effective collaborator, educator, or scientist requires effective communication. Understanding is not delivered by the speaker, so
				 perceptive listening is at least as important as concise speaking. Marshall always pays careful attention to his audience when speaking and
				 even more careful attention when listening, especially when students describe their reasoning. This practice permits
				 <dfn>formative assessment</dfn> during class time, monitoring and guiding student progress through direct in-class discussion.			 
				 Further aiding classroom efficacy, Marshall is an expert in Socratic dialogue, the art and science of teaching by asking questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				All scientific research requires well-developed analytical skills. Over the course of Marshall's previous laboratory and practical experience, 
				 extensive coursework both in physics and other sciences, current research in physics education, and hobby programming, his logic and reasoning
				 abilities have been honed sharper and sharper. These skills are incredibly useful for extending existing knowledge and approaching new 
				 problems in research, the classroom, and daily life.
			</p>
			
			<h2 id="exp">Experience</h2>
			<p>			
				Marshall has a wide range of laboratory, classroom, and collaborative experience. A brief formal summary may be found in his
				 <a href="documents/Styczinski_CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae, linked here</a>. Last updated: Aug 6, 2015. For more details about any item,
				 please contact Marshall at the email address listed at the bottom of this page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ever since beginning his physics education in high school, Marshall has excelled at helping others learn physics. At first, 
				 he helped peers to share in the same insights, and over time he has honed his skills in tutoring and teaching with time spent
				 engaged in and studying the teaching of physics. While &quot;there is no substitute for experience,&quot; as the saying goes,
				 Marshall has also supplemented his techniques and practices by studying best practices recommendations in the Physics
				 Education Research (PER) literature and books on the teaching of physics. A primary source for reflection and guidance in this
				 has been Arnold Arons's <em>Teaching Introductory Physics.</em> 
			</p>
			<p>
				Marshall's undergraduate studies at the University of California, Davis (UCD) included a wide variety of curricular and
				 extra-curricular engagements. He offered several hours weekly as a volunteer tutor for introductory physics students, 
				 with the student-run Physics Club at UCD's drop-in tutoring program. Employment as a course administrator for the 
				 algebra-based physics series at UCD led to Marshall's proficiency with FileMaker database software; his facility with this 
				 software has only improved as a result of continuing to use along with his graduate research.
			</p>
			<p>
				For nearly every term as a graduate student at the University of Washington (UW), Marshall has held a teaching assistantship (TA).
				 Depending on assignment, this usually involves 10-15 hours per week of scheduled in-class time, spent in a teaching role in a classroom
				 or tutoring in the Physics Study Center on campus. Marshall always encourages students to schedule to meet with him or email questions
				 whenever they have cause. Research, self-reflection, student evaluations, and a huge and growing amount of tutoring and teaching 
				 experience have helped shape Marshall into a very responsive, insightful, and effective educator who excels at enhancing students' 
				 learning of physics. 
			</p>
			<p>			
				While an undergraduate, Marshall restored a complex angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) system in an 
				 ultra-high vacuum chamber to prime operating condition. Deteriorating condition and accidental damage from experimental mistakes
				 had led to the system's dormancy for a decade prior to the restoration project. Upon recommendation for his performance and 
				 thorough documentation of this project in an honors thesis, Marshall was awarded the &quot;with Highest Honors&quot; distinction for 
				 his B.S. in Physics. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks to reputation earned with specialists working in labs at UC Davis, Marshall was recommended for a paid position as a technician
				 in a different lab. The primary goal of this short-term position was to repair another damaged experimental system operating in high vacuum,
				 but the appointment was extended several times, each time for brief involvement in a different experiment. After successfully restoring
				 that system (an evaporative deposition chamber for indium), Marshall was invited to assist in the delicate construction of one of the Double Chooz
				 neutrino detectors at a nuclear facility in France. Once that work was completed, he was asked to design, build, and carry out a proof-of-concept
				 experiment for assisting the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) direct dark matter detection experiment. Marshall was challenged to sonically track
				 gas bubbles created by controlled heating in a calm liquid nitrogen bath which mimicked the dimensions of the LUX detector. 
			</p>			
			<p>
				Following all of these projects, Marshall was offered yet another appointment as a technician, assisting in the final phase of
				 an NSF-funded experiment studying time-resolved radiation damage of permanent magnets. Through each of the experiments with which Marshall
				 has been involved, he has gained experience with a wide variety of software, hardware, safety, and procedural elements.
