			<h2>History</h2>			
			<p>			
				Marshall J. Styczinski was born in Dublin, California in 1988. He received his high school diploma in 2006 from Portola High School in eastern California.
				 Four years later, he completed his Bachelor of Science degree in physics with Highest Honors at the University of California, Davis. He joined
				 the Physics Department at the University of Washington in 2012; for more information on Marshall's experience and qualifications,
				 <a href="pages/experience.shtml">visit the experience page.</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Marshall lives in the Lake City neighborhood of Seattle with his partner, Nichole.

			<h2>Recreation</h2>
			<p>
				Though Marshall is passionate about physics, education, research, and Physics Education Research, he has many other interests.
				 Some of his primary recreational interests are presented below.
			</p>
			
				<h3>Crafts</h3>
				<p>
					Creation of 3-dimensional artwork is one of Marshall's favorite hobbies. Past projects include wood and foam carving, paper mache, woodworking,
					 and metalworking. Shown below is his latest work-in-progress, the capstone of an extensive costume honoring <a href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a>.
				</p>

				</div>
			
				<p>
					Similarly, Marshall enjoys creating physically accurate 3-dimensional simulations, themselves electronic artwork. Some examples of his work may
					 be found in his <a href="http://www.glowscript.org/#/user/Mesons/folder/My_Programs/">program staging area on the GlowScript website</a>. A sample
					 animation is below--click the image to toggle animation.

					<script>
						var anim = false;
						document.getElementById('emwcontainer').innerHTML = '<img id="emw" src="images/EM_waves_still.gif" class="portrait" style="width:742px; height:378px; cursor:pointer;" title="Sample of a 3D simulation" alt="Sample image of a 3D simulation program">';

				<h3>Electronic Entertainment</h3>
				<p>
					When the opportunity arises, Marshall delights in playing video games, especially with friends. One of his top favorites is
					 <a href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a>. It's a particularly enjoyable game, where spacecraft are built
					 from the ground up, one functional piece at a time (like LEGOs), then flown in a virtual solar system, all according to 
					 well-modelled physics.
				</p>
				<p> 
					The unique challenge represented in overcoming engineering hurdles in a true-to-form physical context
					 affords the player a unique sense of accomplishment in completing in-game goals, such as landing on planets and moons. Below is an image from 
					 Kerbal Space Program, wherein three Kerbals are commemorating having landed their rocket on the M&#252;n (the moon of planet Kerbin,
					 home of the Kerbals and analogous to Earth).

				<h3>Outdoors</h3>
				<p>
					Marshall thoroughly enjoys hiking and kayaking. Few surroundings instill a feeling of peace as does the calm of a lush, green forest.
				</p>

				</div>				
				
				<p>
					Living near connected waterways in Seattle affords plenty of opportunity to explore the city from the water.
					 Graduate studies are very busy work, but when Nichole's and Marshall's schedules permit it, they like to paddle around.
