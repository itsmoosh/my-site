			<h2>History</h2>			
			<p>			
				I was born in Dublin, California in 1988. I received my high school diploma in 2006 from Portola High School in eastern California. Four years later, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in physics with Highest Honors at the University of California, Davis. I joined the Physics Department at the University of Washington in 2012; for more information on my experience and qualifications, <a href="pages/experience.shtml">visit the experience page.</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Hilltop neighborhood of Tacoma is where I call home, along with my brother, William.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Recreation</h2>
			<p>
				Though I'm passionate about space physics, Europa, teaching, and outreach, I have many other interests. Graduate studies are a busy time, but there are some fun activities I try to make time for:
			</p>
			
				<h3>Crafts</h3>
				<p>
					Creation of 3-dimensional artwork is one of my favorite hobbies. Past projects include wood and foam carving, paper mache, woodworking, and metalworking. Shown below is a recent work-in-progress, the capstone of an extensive costume honoring <a href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a>.
				</p>
				<div class="portrait" style="width:558px; height:424px;">
					<a href="images/kerbal_helmet_ip.jpg"><img src="images/kerbal_helmet_ip.jpg" class="portrait" style="width:558px; height:424px;" title="An in-progress art project" alt="An in-progress art project: head and helmet for a Kerbal Space Program costume" /></a>
				</div>
			
				<p>
					Similarly, I enjoy creating 3-dimensional simulations, themselves electronic artwork. In previous work in physics education research, I created some simulations for educational purposes. Examples may be found in my <a href="http://www.glowscript.org/#/user/Mesons/folder/My_Programs/">program staging area on the GlowScript website</a>. A sample animation is below--<span style="font-weight:bold;">click the image to toggle animation.</span>

				<div id="emwcontainer" class="portrait" style="width:742px; height:378px;">
					<script>
						var anim = false;
						document.getElementById('emwcontainer').innerHTML = '<img id="emw" src="images/EM_waves_still.gif" class="portrait" style="width:742px; height:378px; cursor:pointer;" title="Sample of a 3D simulation" alt="Sample image of a 3D simulation program">';
						document.getElementById('emw').onclick = function(){ anim = toggleAnim(anim); }			
					</script>
					<noscript>
						<a href="images/EM_waves.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/EM_waves_still.gif" class="portrait" style="width:742px; height:378px;" title="Sample of a 3D simulation" alt="Sample image of a 3D simulation program"></a>

				<p>
					This program is used to demonstrate how electric and magnetic fields oscillate in waves of light. <a href="http://www.glowscript.org/#/user/Mesons/folder/Simulations/program/EMPlaneWave">Click here for the interactive program.</a>
				</p>

				<h4>More fun coding projects</h4>
				<p>
					I frequently create programs and graphics for sharing my research, and sometimes completely for fun. When I think others might enjoy or benefit from that products I create, I add them to <a href="https://github.com/itsmoosh/fun/">my &apos;fun&apos; GitHub repository!</a> Here's an example of a diagram I created of the solar system, on a logarithmic scale, for an important day in my life:
				</p>

				<div class="plain-img" style="width:500px; height:500px;">
					<a href="images/orrery.png"><img src="images/orrery.png" class="plain-img" style="width:500px; height:500px;" title="Log-scale solar system diagram for 2009-05-22" alt="Concentric ellipses with black dots representing the positions of the planets and scattered asteroids." /></a>
				</div>

				<p>
					The Python code for this diagram <a href="https://github.com/itsmoosh/fun/tree/master/log_scale_orrery">can be found here,</a> in my &apos;fun&apos; GitHub repository. The program will accept any date, so download it and plot the planets for your special day!
				</p>
				
				<h3>Electronic Entertainment</h3>
				<p>
					When the opportunity arises, I delight in playing video games, especially with friends. One of my top favorites is <a href="http://kerbalspaceprogram.com">Kerbal Space Program</a>. It's unique among video games: An earth-and-space simulator, accessible for those of all backgrounds. You build and fly your own planes and rockets, put together like LEGOs--one piece at a time. From landing modules to space stations, it's a great way to indulge your creative side.
				</p>
				<p> 
					Sending little green people on missions to another planet, even in a virtual universe, is a very rewarding experience. Shown below are my Kerbals commemorating a successful landing on Tylo, a moon of the gas giant Jool.
				</p>		
				
				<div class="portrait" style="width:748px; height:286px;">
					<a href="images/kerbal_Tylo_rove.png"><img src="images/kerbal_Tylo_rove.png" class="portrait" style="width:748px; height:286px;" title="Kerbals roving around on Tylo, a moon of Jool." alt="Three green aliens on a cratered surface, in Kerbal Space Program." /></a>
				</div>	
				
				<h3>Outdoors</h3>
				<p>
					I find hiking, climbing, and kayaking to be fantastic ways to unwind and de-stress. Few surroundings instill a feeling of peace as does the calm of a lush, green forest, or a still lake echoing with birdsong. I make frequent trips to enjoy the nearby Cascade mountains and Olympic mountains.
				</p>
				
				<div class="portrait" style="width:558px; height:418px;">
					<a href="images/hoh_rainforest.jpg"><img src="images/hoh_rainforest.jpg" class="portrait" style="width:558px; height:418px;" title="Morning in the Hoh Rainforest" alt="On the trail in a lush forest" /></a>
				</div>				
				
				<p>
					Living near connected waterways in Seattle affords plenty of opportunity to explore the city from the water. Graduate studies are very busy work, but when my schedule permits it, I like to paddle around.
				</p>				
				
				<div class="portrait" style="width:558px; height:408px;">
					<a href="images/kayaking.jpg"><img src="images/kayaking.jpg" class="portrait" style="width:558px; height:408px;" title="Kayaking in Seattle" alt="Marshall and Nichole kayaking" /></a>
