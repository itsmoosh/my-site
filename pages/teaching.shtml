			<h2>Teaching overview</h2>			
			<p>
				Learning is complicated. Everyone responds differently to the same stimuli, including their interactions
				 with an instructor. A positive learning experience isn't simply related to whether or not a course is
 				 taught by a &quot;good&quot; instructor. Nevertheless, an experienced, responsive instructor in a
				 conducive classroom setting can facilitate student learning.
			</p>

			</div>
			
			<p>
				Well-designed instructional materials can also lend a lot of support to the goal of students learning as
				 much as possible from our time with them. The <cite>Tutorials in Introductory Physics</cite>, researched, developed,
				 and validated all by the <a href"http://depts.washington.edu/uwpeg/">Physics Education Group</a> at UW,
				 compose just such a supporting material. All calculus-based introductory physics courses at UW involve
				 a supplementary <dfn>tutorial</dfn> section, where students work in small groups to discuss a topic covered
				 in the tutorial workbook.
			</p>
			
			<p>				 
				In tutorial sections, two teaching assistants (<dfn>TA</dfn>s) act as navigators, guiding up to six groups
				 of 2&ndash;4 students with reflective questioning. Each week, the TAs meet to work through the tutorials with
				 an experienced TA so that they are better prepared to address student questions and difficulties during
				 in-class sessions. Marshall has been a tutorial TA for ten quarters, most often in the Electricity &amp;
				 Magnetism introductory course. He also leads groups of TAs during weekly preparation meetings. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Teaching philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				Several studies have convincingly concluded that compared to traditional instructional strategies, learning is
				 best enhanced when students are actively engaged&mdash;analyzing, interpreting, explaining, or otherwise exploring
				 the subject matter <em>themselves</em>. In this context, &quot;traditional&quot; implies <dfn>didactic</dfn>
				 instruction, centered around reading reference textbooks written by experts and frequent lecture presentations
				 by the instructor, also an expert. A large and growing body of research in physics education has shown that
				 experts describing their knowledge and making unsubstantiated assertions to students is not an effective way
				 to encourage learning.

			</div>		
			
			<p>
				Marshall takes his teaching seriously. The primary guiding principle behind his classroom demeanor is always
				 one of the first announcements he makes in class:
			</p>
				 <blockquote>I am here to help you learn.</blockquote>
			<p>
				Students are encouraged to ask questions by email, day or night. Office hours are also available upon request
				 or during scheduled study center hours (see <a href="pages/teaching.shtml#assignment">the table above</a> for scheduling).
			</p>
							
			<p>				
				Marshall aims to keep students engaged and he encourages every student to participate in group discussions.
				 Engagement is sustained through periodic discussions with students, frequently involving both open-ended
				 and guiding questions. These questions are intended to not only to help students stay on track, but also
				 to give students immediate feedback on their explanations. Tutorial assessments (homework and free-response
				 exams) always require a thorough explanation of reasoning alongside their response to a <dfn>qualitative</dfn>
				 question, one where the response does not require a numerical calculation. The immediate feedback an attentive
				 instructor can provide to students during class time can be very valuable to both student and instructor,
				 especially when students are asked to explain their reasoning in detail.

			<h2>Student testimonials</h2>
			<p>
				At the conclusion of each term at UW, the Office of Educational Assessment administers course evaluations. Students'
				 opinions about their experiences are solicited in a variety of ways, including free-response questions. Marshall
				 reviews all of his course evaluations, both to get a sense of how he is doing managing the class and to find
				 suggestions for improvement. A selection of student responses to these evaluations appears in the table below, one
				 at a time. To see <a href="supporting/studentEvals.xml">the full list of selected student comments, click here.</a>
