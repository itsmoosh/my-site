			<h2>Physics Education Research</h2>
			<p>
				Marshall's area of specialization is in physics education research (PER).
				 PER is an example of <dfn>discipline-based education research,</dfn> in that
				 it is generally conducted by researchers in a physics department, most often
				 with formal academic training in physics. Physics education researchers are 
				 uniquely well-suited to study the teaching and learning of physics because
				 they are intimately well-acquainted with the subject matter, and they are 
				 scientists first and foremost.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the name suggests, <em>physics</em> education research is primarily 
				 concerned with improving the teaching and learning of physics. Learning
				 is very complicated, so there are many sub-fields and specializations under the 
				 blanket of PER. As with all science, theoretical modeling and experimental
				 data collection are involved and are rarely independent. Most groups have
				 a primary thematic focus, like one or more of these examples:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>K-12 teacher training and scientific literacy</li>
				<li>Progression of development from novice-like to expert-like reasoning</li>
				<li>Instructional practice and classroom structure</li>
				<li>Student attitudes toward physics or science</li>
			<\ul>
			<p>
				The primary focus of the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington
				 (UWPEG) is understanding and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics.
				 Student understanding is probed and researched via carefully constructed pretests
				 and post-tests; detailed curricular materials are created to help students 
				 recognize, assess, and build on their own model; researchers are also instructors
				 in the class and can observe first-hand how students respond to the curricula.
				 The process of development of curriculum, research, and instruction is rarely
				 linear, and most often there is a complex inter-play between these three facets.
			</p>
			<p>
				UWPEG has released two primary curricula based on and validated by research, 
				<em>Physics by Inquiry</em> and <em>Tutorials in Introductory Physics</em>.
				While both are still in active development, these resources are widely used in the
				US, with several international sites using them as well. For more information,
				<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwpeg/">visit the UWPEG web site.</a>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Research Focus</h2>
			<p>
				Marshall studies the time students spend in class and on assignments, aiming to 
				 find areas where we can do more with less.
