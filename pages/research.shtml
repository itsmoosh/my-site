			<h2>Physics Education Research</h2>
			<p>
				Marshall's area of specialization is in physics education research (PER).
				 PER is an example of <dfn>discipline-based education research,</dfn> in that
				 it is generally conducted by researchers in a physics department, most often
				 with formal academic training in physics. Physics education researchers are 
				 uniquely well-suited to study the teaching and learning of physics because
				 they are intimately well-acquainted with the subject matter, and they are 
				 scientists first and foremost.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the name suggests, <em>physics</em> education research is primarily 
				 concerned with improving the teaching and learning of physics. Learning
				 is very complicated, so there are many sub-fields and specializations under the 
				 blanket of PER. As with all science, theoretical modeling and experimental
				 data collection are involved and are rarely independent. Most groups have
				 a primary thematic focus, like one or more of these examples:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>K-12 teacher training and scientific literacy</li>
				<li>Progression of development from novice-like to expert-like reasoning</li>
				<li>Instructional practice and classroom structure</li>
				<li>Student attitudes toward physics or science</li>
			</ul>

				In Spring 2016, Marshall was proud to present an introduction to PER and his research
				 at Town Hall theater in Seattle as part of the
				 <a href="https://townhallseattle.org/event_category/uw-science-now/">UW Science now speaker series.</a>
				 These presentations are meant for everyone, regardless of experience and background.
				 Marshall's presentation, &quot;Making physics more accessible&quot;, is available
				 below. Have a watch!

			<p>
				The primary focus of the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington
				 (UWPEG) is understanding and addressing student conceptual difficulties in physics.
				 Student understanding is probed and researched via carefully constructed pretests
				 and post-tests; detailed curricular materials are created to help students 
				 recognize, assess, and build on their own model; researchers are also instructors
				 in the class and can observe first-hand how students respond to the curricula.
				 The process of development of curriculum, research, and instruction is rarely
				 linear, and most often there is a complex inter-play between these three facets.
			</p>
			<p>
				UWPEG has released two primary curricula based on and validated by research, 
				 <em>Physics by Inquiry</em> and <em>Tutorials in Introductory Physics.</em>
				 While both are still in active development, these resources are widely used in the
				 US, with several international sites using them as well. For more information,
				 <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwpeg/" target="_blank">visit the UWPEG web site.</a>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Research Focus: Doing more with less</h2>
			<p>
				Budgeting time is challenging. As an instructor, choices about what to cover and
				 in how much detail are always close at hand. Much of Marshall's research is devoted
				 to maximizing what students take away from class-related activities, especially in-class
				 group work and homework. Getting more out of the time spent, or &quot;doing more
				 with less,&quot; is the main goal. Occupying less time allows for other fruitful in-class
				 activities, and everyone wants students to learn more from the time they spend.   
			</p>
			<p>
				A strong research tradition precedes Marshall, and he carries it forward with pride.
				 The <em>Tutorials in Introductory Physics</em> created by current and former members of
				 UWPEG have seen decades of research, validation, instruction, and gradual improvement.
				 The research literature is always growing, and there are often golden nuggets to be
				 found therein that can help enhance the <em>Tutorials.</em> Marshall's recent work
				 has centered on poring over tutorials from Electricity and Magnetism, aiming to condense
				 topics to take less in-class time to cover.

			</div>			
			<p>
				The <em>Tutorials</em> are not only based on research on difficult topics, they are also
				 carefully validated. Careful studies controlling for students' experiences 
				 demonstrate that each tutorial worksheet has an overall impact, helping many students
				 learn the concepts better than alternatives like solving textbook problems. To maintain this
				 research validation, every major change (like combining tutorials) is followed by another
				 careful validation study&mdash;we want students to learn as well or better than before.
				 Marshall is in the midst of a study re-validating several tutorials he reconfigured to
				 take less time.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Supporting his work on improving time spent in-class, Marshall is beginning a project
				 for characterizing the types of student behavior when working through tutorials in groups.
				 Understanding how students engage with the questions and their group can be used to 
				 guide the development of better tutorial worksheets&mdash;by ensuring students are maximizing
				 effective behaviors like explaining their reasoning to each other, we ensure they get the
				 most out of their time with their group and instructors.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the horizon, Marshall will also be studying avenues to combine interactive simulations
				 with student homework assignments, with the ultimate goal of improving what students
				 learn from completing homework without spending more time than they do already. Many research
				 studies show great potential for student learning with 
				 <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">interactive simulations, like the PhETs.</a>
				 Students are always under a burdensome, stressful workload, however. We can't simply ask them
				 to spend their free time using a simulation, and cutting out other effective assignments 
				 might do more harm than good. That's where Marshall's careful research and experience 
				 rewriting curriculum comes in. He'll be consulting the research literature to form a well-grounded
				 plan, choosing which exercises to remove or tailor to an added simulation in order for students
				 to get the most out of the time they spend on homework.
